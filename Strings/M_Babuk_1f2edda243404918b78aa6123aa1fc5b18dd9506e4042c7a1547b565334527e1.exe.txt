* 6 simple steps do minimize harm from ransomware.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of companies around the world are struggling on ransomware these days, and the most of companies are making the same mistakes again and again. Let
s figure out how to minimize harm and do not be a dumb and pathetic donkey which will make fun for journalists and so on..
1. If you see small fella malicious .exe file never load it to virustotal.com or any other virus researching website.
Otherwise the info about the hack is not a secret anymore. The fact that your company is under ransomware attack is already known by filthy predators data security agents who will post in their pity twitters the fresh known news 
OMG ANOTHER RANSOMWARE NOW IT
Your company name LLC!!!!! We are all gonna die aaaaaa halp
2. No any public announcements about the hack or data leakage. And do not applicate to law enforcement.
If you commit this actions, more serious consequences can occur and you pay much more than a ransom amount. Law structures like GDPR in this case can oblige you to pay huge fine.
3. As soon as you see your network compromised, follow the link inside any note and follow instructions.
4. Calm your employees.
Explain them that this is a drill. And you test your network security systems.
5. If you decide to hire the data recovery company, obligate them to do not inform anyone and any third party about details of the attack.
We strongly do not recommend to cooperate with data recovery company, because they do absolutely nothing that you can do by yourself and take money for it. all communications with hackers could be conducted by your it department indipendently without any extra payments.
6. Do not try to decrypt your data via 3rd party software.
Most of ransomware use strong encryption algorthm and you can harm your files by using 3rd party decryption software.
